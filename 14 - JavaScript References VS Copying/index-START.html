    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // original string will not update another string assigned to it..
    // let name = "Alissa";
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = "B'Alissa";
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // same for numbers
    // let fav = 9;
    // let fav2 = fav;
    // console.log(fav, fav2);
    // fav = 10;
    // console.log(fav, fav2);



    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;
    // console.log(players, team);
    team[3] = "Lux";

    // team is a reference to players

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // any of these ways creates a copy, without a direct reference
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99; // this updates the person object!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}; // found in React

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const alissa = {
      name: 'Alissa',
      age: 500,
      social: {
        insta: '@ui.engineer',
        twitter: '@alissalikavec'
      }
    }

    const dev = Object.assign({}, alissa);
    // dev.name can be changed separately, dev.social.twitter is too deep and will affect the original object!

    // shakes all the references..performance may be funky. The poor man's deep clone:
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(alissa));
